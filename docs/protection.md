# Replication halt (experimental)

An admin kill-switch for kaf-mirror. **Off by default.**

If the source cluster is compromised, kaf-mirror will copy that traffic onto the replica unless you stop it. This feature is how you freeze replication. It is experimental: it can false-positive, and it does not protect Kafka itself.

## Why this exists

In a live incident the **source** cluster was ransomed. kaf-mirror kept running and replicated the attack. Data **already** stored by kafscale on S3 was not encrypted — those objects are read-only. New writes from the mirror would still have landed as new (bad) objects.

This switch stops **new** replication. It does not decrypt the source, and it does not roll back the replica.

## Turn it on

You must be an admin (`protection:manage`).

```bash
mirror-cli protection enable
mirror-cli protection status
```

Same thing over the API: `POST /api/v1/protection/enable`.

### API

Base path `/api/v1`. Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

| Method | Path | Who | What |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/protection` | any logged-in user | Status (enabled, halted, reason) |
| POST | `/protection/enable` | admin (`protection:manage`) | Turn the feature on |
| POST | `/protection/disable` | admin | Turn it off and clear an API halt |
| POST | `/protection/halt` | admin | Pause every job. Body: `{"reason":"..."}` |
| POST | `/protection/resume` | admin | Clear an API halt. Does not restart jobs. Does not clear `data/HALT` or `KAF_MIRROR_HALT`. |

Cluster create/update JSON includes `role`: `prod`, `dr`, or `other`.

Swagger: `/swagger/index.html` (tag **protection**).

To arm it at process start, set in config:

```yaml
protection:
  enabled: true
  halt_file: "data/HALT"
  halt_env: "KAF_MIRROR_HALT"
  auto_halt:
    enabled: true
```

Until this is on: no halt file, no env, no auto-stop, and jobs into `prod` clusters are allowed as usual.

## Label clusters

When you add a cluster, set `role`:

| Role | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `prod` | Production. While protection is on, kaf-mirror will **not** start a job that writes **into** this cluster. |
| `dr` | Replica / DR (including a kafscale/S3-backed cluster). |
| `other` | Default. No extra rule. |

Mark the live source `prod` and the replica `dr`.

## Stop all replication (halt)

Any of these pause **every running job**. Jobs stay paused until an admin starts them again.

| How | Command |
|---|---|
| CLI | `mirror-cli protection halt "source compromised"` |
| API | `POST /api/v1/protection/halt` with `{"reason":"source compromised"}` |
| File | create `data/HALT` (path is `protection.halt_file`) |
| Env | `KAF_MIRROR_HALT=1` (name is `protection.halt_env`) |
| Auto | traffic looks like encryption or a delete storm (see below) |

Use the **file or env** if the API is down. The dashboard shows a banner when halt is active.

## Resume

Halt from the CLI/API is cleared with:

```bash
mirror-cli protection resume
```

That does **not** clear a halt file or `KAF_MIRROR_HALT`. Remove the file and unset the env or replication stays stopped.

Resume does **not** restart jobs. When you trust the source:

```bash
mirror-cli jobs start <job-id>
```

## Automatic halt

When protection is on, `auto_halt.enabled` is also on (same experiment — there are no per-detector toggles).

kaf-mirror samples records and will halt if:

- Many **existing keys** get new **high-entropy** values (looks like encrypt-in-place on the source), or a large volume of high-entropy payloads when keys are unique
- A flood of **empty values** (tombstones / deletes)
- A burst of produce/auth errors
- Payloads get much larger while source lag suddenly drops

These are heuristics. They can fire on a legitimate bulk rewrite. If you already know the source is bad, halt yourself; do not wait for auto.

Automatic halt cannot see ransomware that only encrypts **S3 objects** under kafscale (for example SSE-C). That is outside the Kafka consume path. Already-written S3 objects staying read-only is still what saved data in the incident.

## What this does not do

- Make Kafka or the replica ransomware-proof
- Delay replication by N minutes
- Prove source and target have the same records (offsets are per cluster). `validate-mirror` uses **source consumer-group lag** and whether topics exist.
- Unlock or restore encrypted source data
